# lab-loader
Quick python script to upload lab configuration files to GNS3 remote server.


Currently only runs on Linux. Will add support to windows via WSL shortly.

Requires mtools be installed on the local machine.

Assumes the "files" folder is in the working directory.

Assumes you have connected to a remote GNS3 server before to grab the IP from the server.conf file.
